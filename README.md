News website resources
## Problem Statement 
I aimed to build Indian News Website with features analogius to famous International Sites and journalistic and Video Journalistic capabilities. I used Joomla DB as a content manager for the site. Along with this used Webpack for the design and implementing functionality of the site. 
I preffered the content manager framework as it is time tested and robust.
The current sites available in the market focus on the narrative of the big corporations in order to stay affloat. My Website on the other hand would offer the readers to give 2-3 Rs daily just to get the updates similar to the cost of a NewsPaper in the city. 
Through this business decision the people would have an incentive to suscribe as the monthly charges would be analogous to their newspaper bills. Further, they would not get overhelmed by the sheer complexity of the content on the newspaper but can get the news relevant to them quickly and effectively. 
A Newsletter mimics the features but in the morning who needs to open a mail and then read the news. With our service just open the app and you would be served with custom news articles without any bias.
